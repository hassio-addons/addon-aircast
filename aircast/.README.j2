AirPlay capabilities for your Chromecast players.

## About

Apple devices use AirPlay to send audio to other devices, but this is not
compatible with Google's Chromecast. This add-on tries to solve this
compatibility gap.

It detects Chromecast players in your network and creates virtual AirPlay
devices for each of them. It acts as a bridge between the AirPlay client
and the real Chromecast player.
